    "### Assignment\n",
    "**Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?**  \n",
    "Ans. According to the basic principle of coding, the factor that makes a language high level is its distance from machine binary code. How many layers of code the language is away from the machine's simple 0s and 1s is what practically decides the level of any programming language. In the software engineering world, Python is understood as a high-level, interpreted general-purpose language. This means it is not your straight compiled language (like Java or C) but an interpreted dynamic language that has to be run in the given system using another program instead of its local processor. When compiled, other languages turn into Assembly and run directly in the processor. Hence, being an interpreted language, which is not subject to the processor, makes Python a high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?**  \n",
    "Ans. Python is dynamically typed, this means that you donâ€™t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like a = 45 and then x=\"Sample String\" without error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?**  \n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "- *Pros* :  Python is free, open-source,Smooth learning curve, High speed of development, Portability and extensibility to other languages, Versatility plus extensive toolset for almost everything like Deep learning , AI, Scientific programming and data science.\n",
    "- *Cons* : Speed limitations, No multithreading, High memory consumption, Hassles with mobile and front-end development, Garbage collection leads to potential memory losses,Slower than compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?**  \n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "- Machine learning / Artificial intelligence\n",
    "- Desktop GUI\n",
    "- Data analytics and data visualization \n",
    "- Web development\n",
    "- Game development\n",
    "- Mobile app development\n",
    "- Embedded systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?**  \n",
    "Ans.  Variables are containers for storing data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 'Sam'\n",
    "b = 65\n",
    "c = True\n",
    "```  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Q8. What is type casting?**  \n",
    "Ans. Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.  \n",

    "**Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?**  \n",

    "**Q10. What are keywords?**  \n",
    "Ans. Keywords are reserved words in Python that are used to trigger specific tasks. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier since these keywords each hold a special meaning. All of the keywords in Python are lowercase.  \n",
    "Ex: print, while, continue, break, if, not, and, return, global, del, pass  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.**  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?**  \n",
    "Ans. Indentation in Python is simply the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Indentation in other languages like C, C++, etc., is just for readability, but in Python, the indentation is an essential and mandatory concept that should be followed when writing a python code; otherwise, the python interpreter throws IndentationError.  \n",

    "**Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?**  \n",
    "Ans. Display output to the console with the built-in function print()."
